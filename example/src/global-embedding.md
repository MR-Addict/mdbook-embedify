# Global Embedding

Some apps allow you to automatically embed to every chapter. You can do this by modifying `book.toml` file to enable them.

For example:

```toml
[preprocessor.embedify]
scroll-to-top.enable = true
```

<!-- embed ignore begin -->

> üí•Attention

> When you do this, you don't need to add `{% embed scroll-to-top %}` manually. It will be automatically added it to every chapter. If you do, it will be rendered twice.

<!-- embed ignore end -->
