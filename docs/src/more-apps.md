# More Apps

In this section, I will show you how to add more apps to this preprocessor.

## Create a new app

You may have some other apps that preprocessor doesn't support yet. However, it's very easy to add a new app based on project custom template engine.

### Template folder

What we need to do is put a new app template in the **src/assets/templates** folder. The template file name should be the app name ended with **.html**.

You can change the template folder path by setting `custom-templates-folder` in the `book.toml` file. The default value is `src/assets/templates`.

```toml
[preprocessor.embedify]
custom-templates-folder = "src/assets/templates"
```

The template folder path shoulde be relative to the book **root** directory.

When custom app name is the same as the built-in app name, the custom app will **override** the built-in app. So you can customize the built-in app by creating a template file with the same name.

### Template file

For example, if we want to add a new app called **youtube**, then we could create a **youtube.html** under templates folder.

We know that we can use an iframe to embed a youtube video. Template file could be like this:

```html
<iframe
  allowfullscreen
  name="youtube"
  loading="lazy"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 1rem; background: black"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
></iframe>
```

> Attention ðŸ’¥

> You can even add **css** and **js** content to the template file which should be put inside `style` and `script` blocks.

However, we want video **id** and **loading** strategy to be dynamic and loading strategy has default **lazy** value. So we can replace them with placeholders like this:

```html
<iframe
  allowfullscreen
  name="youtube"
  loading="{% loading=lazy %}"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/{% id %}"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 1rem; background: black"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
></iframe>
```

This way, we can use the **embed** macro to embed a youtube video by passing **id** and **loading** options.

## Placeholder syntax

The template placeholder is a way to add dynamic values to the template file. It allows you to replace static values with dynamic ones that can be provided by the user when they use the app.

### Syntax

There are two ways of adding dynamic values to the template file:

- Only put key name in the placeholder, like **{% key %}**, and you can add default value after the key name, like **{% key=default %}**. The default value will be used if user doesn't provide the value.
- Wrapped with preprocessor name, like **{% processor(key=default) %}**. The processor name is like as function name, it will be used to process the inner value and replace the placeholder.

**Placeholder**

The inner value is key follwed by a default value in the form of **key=default**. If the key is not provided, the default value will be used.

**Preprocessor**

Now only **markdown** is supported, markdown will treat the inner value as markdown content and render it to be html.

### Examples

- **{% id %}** means the placeholder will be replaced by the value of **id** key and id is not optional because it doesn't have a default value.
- **{% loading=lazy %}** means the placeholder will be replaced by the value of **loading** key. If user doesn't provide the value, the default value **lazy** will be used.
- **{% markdown(message) %}** means the placeholder will be replaced by the value of **message** processed by **markdown** processor.

## Use the new app

After creating the template file, we can use the new app in our markdown files.

<!-- embed ignore begin -->

```text
{% embed youtube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" loading="eager" %}
```

Because the `loading` key has a default value `lazy`, we can omit it.

```text
{% embed youtube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" %}
```

<!-- embed ignore end -->

## Conclusion

That's it. You can also use the same method to add your own custom apps to this preprocessor.

Just **clone** this repository and add your own app template to the **src/assets/templates** folder.
