# More Apps

In this section, I will show you how to add more apps to this preprocessor.

## Create a new app

You may have some other apps that preprocessor doesn't support yet. However, it's very easy to add a new app based on project custom template engine.

What we need to do is put a new app template in the **templates** folder. The template file name should be the app name ended with **.html**.

For example we want to add a new app called **youtube**, then we could create a **youtube.html** under **templates** folder.

We know that we can use an iframe to embed a youtube video. Template file could be like this:

```html
<iframe
  allowfullscreen
  name="youtube"
  loading="lazy"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 1rem; background: black"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
></iframe>
```

> You can even add **style** and **js** content to the template file. But the style and js content should be put in the style and js blocks.

However, we want video **id** and **loading** strategy to be dynamic and loading strategy has default **lazy** value. So we can replace them with placeholders like this:

```html
<iframe
  allowfullscreen
  name="youtube"
  loading="{% loading=lazy %}"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/{% id %}"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 1rem; background: black"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
></iframe>
```

There are two ways of adding dynamic values to the template file:

- Only put key name in the placeholder, like **{% key %}**, and you can add default value after the key name, like **{% key=default %}**. The default value will be used if user doesn't provide the value.
- Wrapped with processor name, like **{% processor(key=default) %}**. The processor name is like as function name, and the key is the argument name. The default value will be used if user doesn't provide the value.

**Function name**

Now only **markdown** is supported, markdown will treat the inner value as markdown content and render it to be html.

**Function argument**

The inner value is key follwed by a default value in the form of **key=default**. If the key is not provided, the default value will be used.

For example:

- **id** means the placeholder will be replaced by the value of **id** key and id is not optional because it doesn't have a default value.
- **loading=lazy** means the placeholder will be replaced by the value of **loading** key. If user doesn't provide the value, the default value **lazy** will be used.
- **markdown(footer)** means the placeholder will be replaced by the value of **footer** processed by **markdown** processor.

## Build the project

After build the project, the new app will be automatically added to the preprocessor binary.

```sh
cargo build --release
```

And you can use it in your book:

<!-- embed ignore begin -->

```text
{% embed youtube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" loading="eager" %}
```

Because the `loading` key has a default value `lazy`, we can omit it.

```text
{% embed youtube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" %}
```

<!-- embed ignore end -->

If you are using this repository as a template, then you can build your book to see the result by running:

```sh
mdbook build docs
```

That's it. If you have some apps need to be added, you can create a new issue or pull request.
