# More Apps

In this section, I will show you how to add more apps to this preprocessor.

## Create a new app

You may have some other apps that preprocessor doesn't support yet. However, it's very easy to add a new app based on project custom template engine.

What we need to do is put a new app template in the **templates** folder. The template file name should be the app name ended with **.html**.

For example we want to add a new app called **youtube**, then we could create a **youtube.html** under **templates** folder.

We know that we can use an iframe to embed a youtube video. Template file could be like this:

```html
<iframe
  allowfullscreen
  name="youtube"
  loading="lazy"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 1rem; background: black"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
></iframe>
```

> ðŸ’¥Attention

> You can even add **style** and **js** content to the template file. But the style and js content should be put in the style and js **blocks**.

However, we want video **id** and **loading** strategy to be dynamic and loading strategy has default **lazy** value. So we can replace them with placeholders like this:

```html
<iframe
  allowfullscreen
  name="youtube"
  loading="{% raw(loading=lazy) %}"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/{% raw(id) %}"
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none; aspect-ratio: 16/9; border-radius: 1rem; background: black"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
></iframe>
```

The placeholder syntax is similar to a **function call** in programming languages, which is the combination of function **name** and **argument** wrapped by **{%** and **%}**.

**Function name**

The preprocessor reconginzes two function names, **raw** and **markdown**. Which raw will keep inner value as it is, markdown will treat the inner value as markdown content and render it to be html.

**Function argument**

The inner value is key follwed by a default value in the form of **key=default_value**. If the key is not provided, the default value will be used.

So **raw(id)** means the placeholder will be replaced by the value of **id** key and id is not optional because it doesn't have a default value.

**raw(loading=lazy)** means the placeholder will be replaced by the value of **loading** key. If user doesn't provide the value, the default value **lazy** will be used. And means loading is optional.

## Build the project

After build the project, the new app will be automatically added to the preprocessor binary.

```sh
cargo build --release
```

And you can use it in your book:

<!-- embed ignore begin -->

```text
{% embed youtube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" loading="eager" %}
```

Because the `loading` key has a default value `lazy`, we can omit it.

```text
{% embed youtube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" %}
```

<!-- embed ignore end -->

If you are using this repository as a template, then you can build your book to see the result by running:

```sh
mdbook build docs
```

That's it. If you have some apps need to be added, you can create a new issue or pull request.
