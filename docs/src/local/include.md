# Include

> Attention ðŸ’¥

> Support since [v0.2.12](https://github.com/MR-Addict/mdbook-embedify/releases/tag/0.2.12).

> Language is detected by file extension, which I manually edited from [linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml). If you find any issues with the language detection, please open an [issue](https://github.com/MR-Addict/mdbook-embedify/issues).

The include app is for including source file or wrapped it as markdown code block.

The language is automatically detected by the file name extension. You can override it by passing `lang` option. The file path should be relative to book root directory.

## Options

| Option | Description                                             | Required | Default     |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :---------- |
| file   | File to include, relative to book root directory        | Yes      | - -         |
| lang   | This will override the automatically detected language  | No       | - -         |
| range  | Range of lines to include, e.g. `1-10` or `1-` or `-10` | No       | - -         |
| type   | Include type, cloud be `raw` or `codeblock`             | No       | `codeblock` |

> Attention ðŸ’¥
>
> - When `range` is used, it will insert the specified lines starts from 1.
> - The `raw` type will insert the raw file content into the markdown file directly, while the `codeblock` type will wrap it as a code block.

## Example

```text
{% embed-ignore include file="src/SUMMARY.md" %}
```

This will include the [src/SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/MR-Addict/mdbook-embedify/blob/main/docs/src/SUMMARY.md) file and wrap it as a markdown code block which is the source code of this book's summary.

{% embed include file="src/SUMMARY.md" %}
